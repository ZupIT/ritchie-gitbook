# How to run formulas

## How to run?

There is two ways to run formulas on Ritchie :

1. Locally
2. Uusing Docker

The **default formulas execution method** has been defined during the initialization step with the**`rit init`**command. It can be changed executing the following command:

```text
rit set formula-runner
```

![rit set formula-runner command](../../.gitbook/assets/large-gif-1374x404-.gif)

### 1. Running Locally

To run a formula locally it is necessary to have the formula programming languages dependencies installed on the computer.

**Example**: a ****formula written in **Node** will need **Node installed** on the computer to run locally.   


### 2. Running through Docker

All formulas can be executed regardless of the programming language used from the moment that you have **`DOCKER`** installed and running.

Follow the example below to see how to run a formula on Ritchie on [**"Hello World" formula section**](commands.md).
