# How to run formulas

## How to run?

There is two ways to run formulas on Ritchie :

* Locally
* using Docker

### Locally

{% hint style="danger" %}
To run a formula locally it is necessary to have the formula programming languages dependencies installed on the computer.

**Example**: _a ****formula written in **Node** will need **Node installed** on the computer to run locally._ 
{% endhint %}

### Docker

{% hint style="danger" %}
All formulas can be executed regardless of the programming language used from the moment that you have **`DOCKER`** installed and running.
{% endhint %}

Follow the example below to see how to run a formula on Ritchie.
