# How to run formulas

## How to run?

There is two ways to run formulas on Ritchie :

1. Locally
2. Uusing Docker

### 1. Running Locally

To run a formula locally it is necessary to have the formula programming languages dependencies installed on the computer.

**Example**: a ****formula written in **Node** will need **Node installed** on the computer to run locally.   


### 2. Running through Docker

All formulas can be executed regardless of the programming language used from the moment that you have **`DOCKER`** installed and running.

Follow the example below to see how to run a formula on Ritchie on [**"Hello World" formula section**](commands.md).
