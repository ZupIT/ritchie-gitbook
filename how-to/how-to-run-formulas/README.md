# How to run formulas

## How to run?

There are two ways to run formulas on Ritchie :

1. Locally
2. Using Docker

The **default formulas execution method** has been defined during the initialization step with the**`rit init`**command. It can be changed executing the following command:

```text
rit set formula-runner
```

![rit set formula-runner command](../../.gitbook/assets/large-gif-1374x404-.gif)

### 1. Running locally

To run a formula locally it is necessary to have the formula programming languages dependencies installed on the computer.

**Example**: a ****formula written in **Node** will need **Node installed** on the computer, so it will be able to run locally.   


### 2. Running through Docker

All formulas can run regardless the programming language used from the moment you have **`DOCKER`** installed and running.

On this section, you saw how to run a formula on Ritchie. To keep learning:

ðŸ‘‰ Go to [**Hello World formula**](commands.md) to see different ways to run a formula on Ritchie. 

ðŸ‘‰ Go to the [**create formulas**](../how-to-create-formulas.md) section to understand how to create your first automation with Ritchie.
