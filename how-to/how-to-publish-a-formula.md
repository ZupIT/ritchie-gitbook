# How to publish a formula

## How to publish?

To publish a formula, you need to push it on **Github / Gitlab**, following these steps:

1. Create an exclusive repository for formulas \(it can be the repository created locally\) on Github / Gitlab.
2. Add a formula on the repository
3. Generate a release
4. Add the repository on Ritchie running the command: 

```text
$ rit add repo
```

Once the repository has been added, Ritchie will automatically use the latest release on your repository to access the available formulas.
