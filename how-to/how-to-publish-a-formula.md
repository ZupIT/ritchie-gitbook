# How to publish formulas

## How to publish?

To publish a formula, you need to push it on **Github / Gitlab**, following these steps:

1. Create an exclusive repository for formulas \(it can be the repository created locally\) on Github / Gitlab.
2. Add a formula on the repository
3. Generate a release

## How to share?

1. Add the repository on Ritchie running the command: 

```text
rit add repo
```

Once the repository has been added, Ritchie will automatically use the latest release on your repository to access the available formulas.

To **check** **the new added formulas command**, execute the **`rit --help`** command and take a look at new groups that will appear.
{% endhint %}
