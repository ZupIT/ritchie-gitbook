# How to encapsulate formulas?

## What is an encapsulation?

On Ritchie, it is possible to **run formulas inside formulas.** This process is what we call **Formula Encapsulation.**‚Äå

This functionality allows you, for example, to make operations in which you need to run consecutive formulas. 

Check out on the following topics how works this encapsulation. 

## How to encapsulate?

### 1. Premisse

To perform a formula encapsulation, it is necessary to use the STDIN flag. On the following page, we have a detailed explanation to how this works: 

{% page-ref page="how-to-use-the-stdin-flag/" %}

### 2. Execution <a id="2-execution"></a>

When [**implementing a formula**](https://app.gitbook.com/@zup-products/s/ritchie/~/diff/drafts/-MHIAf91S1RlTOvJs_KU/how-to/implement-a-formula/@drafts), the file where the operation is coded needs to execute a command line associated to a formula.‚Äå

The encapsulated formula command line needs to be executed using the STDIN flag, informing the inputs parameters directly on the code.‚Äå

### 3. Example <a id="3-example"></a>

The **`rit publish repo`** formula has been implemented using formula encapsulation, that you can find its [**formula implementation**](https://github.com/ZupIT/ritchie-formulas/tree/master/publish/repo).

On the example below, you'll find below how this encapsulation works on the code part.

{% hint style="warning" %}
This formula has been implemented using **`Shell`**and the reasoning would be the same for any other programming language.
{% endhint %}

```text
runFormula() {
  if [ "Github" == $PROVIDER ]
  then
    echo "üêô Github provider selected"
    echo '{"privacy":"'$PRIVACY'", "project_name":"'$PROJECT_NAME'", "workspace_path":"'$WORKSPACE_PATH'", "version":"'$VERSION'"}' | rit github publish repo --stdin
  elif [ "Gitlab" == $PROVIDER ]
  then
    echo "ü¶ä Gitlab provider selected"
    echo '{"privacy":"'$PRIVACY'", "project_name":"'$PROJECT_NAME'", "workspace_path":"'$WORKSPACE_PATH'", "version":"'$VERSION'"}' | rit gitlab publish repo --stdin
  else
    echo "ü§ñ Unexpected Provider informed. Check it please and try again."
  fi
}
```

Here, according to the input informed by the user, two different formulas can be executed:‚Äå

* **`rit github publish repo`**
* **`rit gitlab publish repo`**

To do so, the encapsulated formulas inputs parameters are informed dynamically according to the inputs parameters of the main formula \(**`rit publish repo`**\). 

Depending on the operation, the JSON used with the STDIN command could be generated according to other operations performed through the formula execution before executing the encapsulated formula command line.‚Äå
