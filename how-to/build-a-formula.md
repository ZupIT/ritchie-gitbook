# How to build a formula

## How to build?

After [**creating a formula**](how-to-create-formulas.md),  if you want to edit the code of the formula, it's necessary to **build** these changes to test the command with the new implementation. 

To do so, just run the command:  ****

```text
$ rit build formula
```

You must inform: 

* The **directory's path** where the formula is located.
* The **formula's path** to be builded \(the formula's command\). 

In case you want to update the formula's code in running time, you can use the **flag ‚Äú--watch‚Äù** as shown in the command below:  
****

```text
$ rit build formula --watch
```

## Next steps 

On this section, you saw how to implement a formula on Ritchie. To keep configuring the formula: 

üëâ Go to [**publish a formula**](how-to-publish-a-formula.md) to see how to transfer your work to a public repository. 

üëâ Go to [**run a formula**](run-a-formula.md) to see how to proceed with formula's executions with Ritchie.
