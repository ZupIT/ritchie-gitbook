# What does Ritchie do?

{% hint style="warning" %}
The tool allows you to create **formulas** that, in other terms, represent programs and /or commands that will facilitate the daily programming work.
{% endhint %}

Letâ€™s take as an example a _microservices_ web application that process payments. In general, the common process for executing this project is to create a whole previous infrastructure, defining a language in the system that will be programmed, downloading dependencies and defining the rules that should be used for the project.

With Ritchie, it's possible to define this configuration using a formula, creating this infrastructure directly by a command line, which in this case will delivered all the structure of the project with all files automatically configured. That helps on avoiding an important time spent on infrastructure and configurations.

Another example - _quite common in teams that operate through **DevOps**_ - is that developers who depend on the infrastructure team to release logs and thus access and operate a system that is in production. When using Ritchie, it is possible to create formulas with access to this system, making the logs available to any user on his terminal.

This, especially in cases of onboarding into development teams, is very advantageous in order to release the permitted accesses and allow developers to start producing as soon as they are integrated into the project.
