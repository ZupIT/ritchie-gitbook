  You will find in this section challenging tasks to start implementing simple
  formulas on Ritchie with a gradual complexity.

# What are tasks?

{% hint style="info" %}
The objective of this section is to help users to understand step by step all Ritchie potential and how it can be used to perform some actions.
{% endhint %}

### Premisses

To perform the tasks in this section, it will be necessary to follow different parts of the tutorial section:

1. [how to run formulas](../how-to/how-to-run-formulas/)
2. [how to create formulas](../how-to/how-to-create-formulas.md)
3. [how to implement formulas](../how-to/implement-a-formula.md)
4. [how to build formulas](../how-to/build-a-formula.md)

### Tasks

The **`first task`** is to understand how to manipulate basic inputs.

{% page-ref page="level-1.md" %}

The **`second task`** is to understand how to manipulate credentials inputs.

{% page-ref page="level-2.md" %}

The **`third tasks`** is to give an example of how to call API services inside a formula.

{% page-ref page="level-3.md" %}



{% hint style="warning" %}
We plan to add more challenging tasks in the future.   
Check it out from time to time!
