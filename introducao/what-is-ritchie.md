# What is Ritchie?

{% hint style="warning" %}
Ritchie is an open source tool that automates your daily and manual tasks with simple commands by creating **formulas** on CLI.
{% endhint %}

 This tool is structured on tree decisions, which allows you to execute your own commands whenever you want to.

## **Where Ritchie came from?**

Ritchie's objective is to improve the developerâ€™s experience, bringing them more autonomy, automating and simplifying the execution of commands that are widely used in the process of creating and developing digital products. Its name is a tribute to **Dennis Ritchie**, one of the creators of Unix \(predecessor of Linux\) and also of the C language. One of the pioneer of the digital world as we know it today.  
  
Despite the number of multidisciplinary teams in the market, a great challenge still is to reduce the dependence that developers have on inputs coming from the infrastructure and operations teams. **DevOps** did a lot to remedy this bottleneck, but it did not completely eliminate the dependency between areas.

{% hint style="warning" %}
With that in mind, we bring a tool to the community that promotes a **NoOps** movement, a solution that automates repetitive operations and streamlines processes \(also known as toil\) that are often hampered in the infrastructure. This will give developers the ability to perform operations that were exclusively the infrastructure's domain.
{% endhint %}

In that way, professionals - on all fronts - gain time to work on more complex and relevant tasks to generate value for their project.
