# What makes Ritchie unique?

Because it is a CLI tool, Ritchie seeks to improve the operational **experience of developers** to its maximum, simplifying repetitive and easy-to-execute tasks that, in many cases, demand a lot of professionals to remember all commands, in addition to their parameters and arguments.

The objective was to reduce the rework of looking for this information in documentation and, thus, promote more time for the development team to focus on their deliveries.

So, instead of writing down on the command lines which parameters and / or arguments the user needs to inform, we do the opposite: Ritchie presents the available options and goes, line by line, asking for the information needed for the command to work, in an interactive way.

In addition, Ritchie works as a **single repository of formulas**. While other CLIs are usually focused on operations related to a single application, in Ritchie you can find, in one place, the operations related to all your registered formulas.

In addition, Ritchie works as a single repository of formulas. While other CLIs are usually focused on operations related to a single application, in Ritchie you can find, in one place, the operations related to all your registered formulas.

In the example below, we have the execution of a scaffold command with the coffee formula. As the user signals which formula he wants to use, the system automatically passes, line by line, asking which specific parameters must be considered to perform the desired action.
