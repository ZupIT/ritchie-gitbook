# Open Source repositories

{% hint style="info" %}
Ritchie is composed of **3 repositories** on Github.
{% endhint %}

1. The [**ritchie-cli**](../developer/cli/) \(open source\) repository that contains the core CLI commands that have priority over the commands of the other operations. 
2. The[ **ritchie-formulas**](../developer/formulas/) \(open source\) repository that contains commons formula commands  that are shared with all Ritchie users. 
3. The [**ritchie-server**](../developer/server/) \(open source\) repository that contains the integrations with the **Vault** and **Keycloak**, necessary for the operation of the _Team_ version of the CLI.

Organizational repositories \(used in the _**Team**_ version\) should ideally follow the following nomenclature: **ritchie-formulas-teamName** \(private / open source\) that contains the commands specific to the team's formulas.
