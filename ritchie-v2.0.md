# About Ritchie V2.0

## **Differences between version 1.0 and 2.0**

* Ritchie versions **Single** and **Team** are deprecated.  _Check the observation below if you still want to use the previous version._ 
* The command tree will be dynamically generated on the added repositories.  _So, it won't be necessary to edit formula's repositories tree.json files anymore._ 
* There isn't a cloud storage anymore.  _The user can import formulas repositories from Github or Gitlab._ \(**`rit add repo`**\) __
* Autocomplete support for 2 new shells: **Fish** and **Powershell**. \(**`rit completion fish`** \| **`rit completion powershell`**\) 
* Support to run formula in a container. \(**`--docker flag`**\) 
* Support to build formulas on Windows OS. 
* New tutorial to the CLI. 
* Structural upgrades.

{% hint style="danger" %}
Version 2.0 **doesn't support Vault to share credentials**.  
Therefore, if you want to keep using those features, you have to stay on the **1.0 version.**
