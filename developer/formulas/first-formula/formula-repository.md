# Formula repository

{% hint style="info" %}
When the command for creating a formula is executed, the user can choose to inform the path to a formula repository already on the machine.

 If there isn't any formula repository available, a formula repository will be created automatically, called **ritchie-formulas-local** in the _HOME_ of the user's machine.
{% endhint %}

If it isn't informed anything and this local repository exists, the new formula will be added there, automatically updating its structure. 

Here is an example of the structure of the local repository with a formula \(inside the group folder\).

{% hint style="danger" %}
The structure of the repositories used to create new formulas must follow the nomenclature indicated on the [formula repositories page](../structure/formula-repositories.md).
