# Standard Inputs

Informing inputs through **arguments** or **flags** allows the user to automate workflows. It is particularly useful when you're manipulating other tools within a script, as you can automate operations without having to interact with the terminal.

Basically, there are two ways to inform input parameters directly on the command lines: 

1. Through the **STDIN** flag .   _**\(will be deprecated in  2021\)**_
2. Through **Input** flags. 

You can check out more about each one on the following pages:
