# How to create formulas

## How to create?

### Step 1: Run the formula creation command

Run the following command to create a formula:

```text
rit create formula
```

Then, you'll have to inform those inputs before running the formula:

1. The **command** \(following the **pattern `rit + group + verb + noun`** to respect the [**tree pattern**](https://docs.ritchiecli.io/key-concepts#command-tree)\).
2. The formula's **programming language**. 
3. **The path** used to save formula's files. 

**Example:** `rit demo create formula`

![Example of running rit create formula command](../../.gitbook/assets/rit-create-formula-3.gif)

### **Step 2: Test your formula** 

You can test the formula directly after its creation. That's possible because  the **`rit create formula`** command also builds the formula automatically \(it generates the formula's executable files and add them on **.rit folder**\).

In that case, the formula **"Hello World" template** will be executed as shown below:

![Example of &quot;Hello-Worl&quot; formula demo](../../.gitbook/assets/large-gif-1054x366-.gif)

This template is composed of 4 **inputs parameters**, that ****represents the currently available kinds of inputs to use Ritchie:

1. A **`sample text`** variable
2. A **`sample list`** of text variables
3. A **`sample boolean`** variable
4. A **`sample password`** variable

## Next steps 

On this section, you saw how to create a formula on Ritchie and test it. To keep configuring the formula: 

ðŸ‘‰ Go to [**implement a formula**](implement-a-formula/) to understand how to edit the files Ritchie creates after formula creation. 

ðŸ‘‰ Go to [**build a formula**](build-a-formula.md) to see how to continue the tests on the formulas you create.
