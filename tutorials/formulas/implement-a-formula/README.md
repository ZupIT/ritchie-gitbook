# How to implement formulas

## How to implement?

Once you have [**created and tested your formula**](../how-to-create-formulas.md), Ritchie will generate a local workspace. This is where you can start implementing the new automation by updating the **Hello World** template.  
  
See below explanations about a formula editable files and all the flexibility offered by Ritchie's structure:

{% page-ref page="formula-folder.md" %}

{% page-ref page="config-file.md" %}

{% page-ref page="main-file.md" %}

{% page-ref page="dependencies.md" %}

## Next steps

On this section, you saw how to implement a formula on Ritchie. To keep configuring the formula:

ðŸ‘‰ Go to [**build a formula**](../build-a-formula.md) to see how to continue the tests on the formulas you create.

ðŸ‘‰ Go to [**publish a formula**](../publish-a-formula.md) to see how to transfer your work to a public repository.
