To install **the latest version of Ritchie** on Windows, you have to download Ritchie's installer and run it on your terminal. 

## Step 1: Installation

You can download the Ritchie **latest** version using this link:[ **latest version**](https://commons-repo.ritchiecli.io/latest/ritchiecli.msi)

Or download any version by pasting this **URL** on your navigator substituting the **`{VERSION}`** field according to the [project repository tags](https://github.com/ZupIT/ritchie-cli/tags):

```text
https://commons-repo.ritchiecli.io/{VERSION}/installer/ritchiecli.msi
```

Once you made it, follow the instructions on your terminal after running the **`rit`** command.
