# Linux

## Step 1: Requirements

If you want to efficiently use Ritchie on Linux with version **`2.0.5 and earlier`**, we recommend to install the following element configured:

* The **make** command

Once you have it, just run the command below at your terminal. 

## Step 2: Installing command

Copy and paste the command below to run on your terminal: 

```text
curl -fsSL https://commons-repo.ritchiecli.io/install.sh | bash
```

{% hint style="info" %}
If you prefer, you also can follow with the[ **manual installation**.](manual-installation.md)
{% endhint %}

## Step 3: Verify installation 

You can confirm if your installation went well by running this command: 

```text
rit --version
```

If everything's configured, the terminal will return Ritchie's current version.
