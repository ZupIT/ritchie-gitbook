# Linux

### Step 1: Requirements

If you wanna use efficiently Ritchie on Linux, , we recommend to install the following elements:

* [Golang](https://golang.org/doc/install)
* The **make** command

Once you have it, just run the command below at your terminal. 

### Step 2: Installing command

Copy and paste the command below to run on your terminal: 

```text
curl -fsSL https://commons-repo.ritchiecli.io/install.sh | bash
```

{% hint style="info" %}
If you prefer, you also can follow with the[ **manual installation**.](manual-installation.md)
{% endhint %}

### Step 3: Verify installation 

You can confirm if your installation went well by running this command: 

```text
$ rit --version
```

If everything's configured, the terminal will return Ritchie's current version.
