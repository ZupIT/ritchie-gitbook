# Windows

## How does it work? 

To install **the latest version of Ritchie \(1.0.0-beta.14\)** on Windows, you just have to click on the links available for each version. 

However, it is important to keep in mind **there are some requirements** before starting the installation on Windows.

### Requirements

If you wanna use efficiently Ritchie on Windows, our recommendation is to install the following programs:

* Powershell
* Cygwin

{% hint style="warning" %}
In case of Cygwin, you'll have to configure the file **/etc/nsswitch.conf** inside the folder \(/ProgramFiles\) and add this non commented line:**`db_home: /%H`**
{% endhint %}

If you prefer, you also can follow with[ **manual installation**.](manual-installation.md)
