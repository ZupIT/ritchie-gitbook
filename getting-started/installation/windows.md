# Windows

To install **the latest version of Ritchie** on Windows, you have to download Ritchie's installer and run it on your terminal. 

### Step 1: Installation

You must [**download Ritchie's installer**](https://commons-repo.ritchiecli.io/latest/ritchiecli.msi) to make this configuration. Once you made it, follow the instructions on your terminal. 

###  Step 2: Configuring environments' variables 

The PATH to use Ritchie on Windows **IS NOT** configured when you download it.  
  
As long as it hasn't been configured, the user will have to go inside the folder where the **rit.exe file** has been downloaded to run Ritchie through this file. Example : **`rit.exe init`**

You'll find a guide about how to set a path here : [**How do I set or change the PATH system variable?**](https://www.java.com/en/download/help/path.xml)

If you prefer, you also can proceed with the[ **manual installation**.]()
{% endhint %}

### Verify installation 

You can confirm if your installation went well by running this command: 

```text
$ rit --version
```

If everything's configured, the terminal will return Ritchie's current version.
