# Run formula "hello-world"

After you finished the previous steps - [**installation**](installation/) and [**initialization**](initialization.md) -, you can run a "hello-world" formula to test Ritchie.

To do so, type the following command line :

```text
$ rit demo hello-world
```

Select an option for each input parameter and see how the magic works:
