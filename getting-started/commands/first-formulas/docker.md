**Explanation** : This command allows you to create a _docker-compose.yml_ file in the directory where the formula is executed. 

The user can choose which tools he wants to include in the file from the inputs requested in the terminal \(if necessary, additional informations are requested\). 

Once the file is created, it is possible to run it normally, via the **docker-compose up** command.

When using docker-compose up, it is necessary to have docker installed.
