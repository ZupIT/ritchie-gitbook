# Executing more commands

If you are more confident to use Ritchie, now it the time to try and use more commands.

There are two ways of executing commands on Ritchie. 

### Prompt 

This is the first way of executing commands on Ritchie, we use prompt to interact with the CLI to inform input parameters.

For more information about core commands via **prompt**:

{% page-ref page="prompt.md" %}

### Stdin

The second way to use Ritchie is through stdin\(standard input\), which means to inform the input parameter in a more traditional way, typing the values directly on the command line that will be executed. 

For more information about core commands via **stdin**:
