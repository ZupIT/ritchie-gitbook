  You will find in this section challenges to start implementing simple formulas
  on Ritchie with a gradual complexity.

# Level 1

## 1. Objective

Create a formula on Ritchie that will **sum two positive numbers**.

{% hint style="info" %}
Command suggestion: **`rit math sum numbers`**
{% endhint %}

## 2. Inputs

This formula needs to contain \(at least\) those two inputs parameters:

1. [ ] Number one \(`NUMBER_ONE`\). 
2. [ ] Number two \(`NUMBER_TWO`\).

## 3. Step by step

The formula needs to follow the next steps:

1. [ ] Extract inputs parameters. 
2. [ ] Convert inputs to integers \(there is currently no _**integer**_ `type` in inputs config.json file\). 
3. [ ] Sum both numbers. 
4. [ ] Return the result on the terminal.

## 4. Improvement suggestions

 If you want to play a little more, here are some suggestions:

* [ ] Add a validation of the input parameters to return an error to the user if the parameter is not an integer. 
* [ ] Allows the user to sum negative numbers with positive ones. 
* [ ] Allows the user to digit decimals in addition to integers. 
* [ ] Allows the user to choose between several operations to manipulate the 2 numbers \(addition, multiplication, division\).
