  Ritchie.

# Level 1: Inputs

## Objective

On this tutorial, the idea is to teach you how to create a formula on Ritchie that will **sum two positive numbers**.

{% hint style="info" %}
Command suggestion: **`rit math sum numbers`**
{% endhint %}

## Inputs

This formula needs to contain \(at least\) those two inputs parameters, see below:

1. Number one \(`RIT_NUMBER_ONE`\). 
2. Number two \(`RIT_NUMBER_TWO`\).

## Step by step

The formula needs to follow the next steps:

1. Extract all inputs parameters. 
2. Convert inputs to integers \(there is currently no _**integer**_ `type` in inputs config.json file\). 
3. Sum both numbers. 
4. Return the result on the terminal.

{% hint style="success" %}
Well done! You've completed the first task! 
{% endhint %}

## Improvement suggestions

 If you want to play a little more, here are some suggestions:

* Add a validation of the input parameters to return an error to the user if the parameter is not an integer. 
* Allow the user to sum negative numbers with positive ones. 
* Allow the user to digit decimals in addition to integers.

## Next steps 

ðŸ‘‰ If you've completed the first challenge, let's go to the [**level 2 task**](level-2.md)!
