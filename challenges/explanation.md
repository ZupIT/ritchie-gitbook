  In this section, you will find challenging tasks to start implementing simple
  formulas on Ritchie with a gradual complexity.
---

# What are these challenges?

## Context 

The objective of this section is to help users to understand step by step several activities  you are able to do with Richie.

### Premises

To perform the tasks in this section, it will be necessary to understand the following concepts:

1. \*\*\*\*[**How to run formulas**](../tutorials/formulas/how-to-run-formulas/)**.**
2. \*\*\*\*[**How to create formulas**](../tutorials/formulas/how-to-create-formulas.md)**.**
3. \*\*\*\*[**How to implement formulas**](../tutorials/formulas/implement-a-formula.md)**.**
4. \*\*\*\*[**How to build formulas**](../tutorials/formulas/build-a-formula.md)**.**
5. \*\*\*\*[**How to encapsulate formulas**](../tutorials/formulas/encapsulate-formulas.md)**.**

### Challenges 

The **`first challenge`** is to understand how to manipulate basic inputs.
