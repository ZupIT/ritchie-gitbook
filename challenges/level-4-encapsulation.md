# Level 5: Encapsulation

## Objective

Create a formula on Ritchie that will **encapsulate another formula inside it.**

{% hint style="warning" %}
You'll find all the informations you need in the [**how to encapsulate formulas**](../how-to/how-to-1.md) tutorial section.
{% endhint %}

  
****The idea is to encapsulate the **`rit demo coffee-go`** formula inside the **Hello World** formula template.

{% hint style="info" %}
Command suggestion: **`rit encapsulate coffee`**
{% endhint %}

## Inputs

In this challenge, it's up to the user to define which inputs he needs. There are a few options:

* Hello Word template inputs + Coffee formula inputs.
* Only the Hello World inputs.
* Only the Coffee formula inputs.
* No input at all.

## Step by step

The formula needs to follow the next steps:

1. Print \(at least\) the Hello World message of the template formula. 
2. A message informing the beginning of the encapsulation. 
3. The execution logs of the encapsulated formula \(**`rit demo coffee-go`**\) 
4. A message informing the end of the encapsulation.

## Improvement suggestions

 If you want to play a little more, here are some suggestions:

* [ ] Code a formula which encapsulate more than one formula.
