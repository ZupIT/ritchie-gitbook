# Level 3: Conditional Inputs

## Objective

Create a formula on Ritchie that will **return the tool selected by the user according to its profile**.

> You'll find all the information you need about the **conditional field** on the [**config.json file section**](https://docs.ritchiecli.io/how-to/implement-a-formula#1-config-json).

{% hint style="info" %}
Command suggestion: **`rit get tools`**
{% endhint %}

## Inputs

This formula needs to contain \(at least\) those two inputs parameters:

* Profile \(`RIT_PROFILE`\). 
* Profile tool \(`RIT_TOOL`\).

The formula inputs will have to respect the diagram below:

## Step by step

The formula needs to follow the next steps:

1. Extract all inputs parameters. 
2. Return the selected profile on the terminal. 
3. Return the selected tool on the terminal.

## Improvement suggestions

 If you want to play a little more, here are some suggestions:

* Install the selected tool according to the computer OS.

## Next steps 

ðŸ‘‰ If you've completed the third challenge, let's go to the [**level 4 task**](level-4-encapsulation.md)!
